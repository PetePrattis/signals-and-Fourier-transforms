# A Matlab Program / Project

**This is a Matlab project from my early days as a Computer Science student**

_This programm was created for the fourth semester class Principles and Applications of Signals and Systems 
and is one of the final projects for the class_

> #### Description of project
>
>>A Matlab script that with Discrete Fourier Transform calculates the Fourier series corresponding to a finite length T signal and the inverse of the given Fourier series.

> #### About this project
